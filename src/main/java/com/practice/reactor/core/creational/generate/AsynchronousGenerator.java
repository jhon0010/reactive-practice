/**
 * create is a more advanced form of programmatic creation of a
 * Flux which is suitable for multiple emissions per round, even from multiple threads.
 * <p>
 * It exposes a FluxSink, with its next, error, and complete methods. Contrary to generate,
 * it doesnâ€™t have a state-based variant. On the other hand, it can trigger multi-threaded events in the callback.
 * <p>
 * create can be very useful to bridge an existing API with the reactive world - such as an asynchronous API based on listeners.
