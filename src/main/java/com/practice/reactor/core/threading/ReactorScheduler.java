/**
 * The Schedulers class has static methods that give access to the following execution contexts:
 *
 * No execution context (Schedulers.immediate()): at processing time, the submitted Runnable will be directly executed,
 * effectively running them on the current Thread (can be seen as a "null object" or no-op Scheduler).
 *
 * A single, reusable thread (Schedulers.single()). Note that this method reuses the same thread for all callers,
 * until the Scheduler is disposed. If you want a per-call dedicated thread, use Schedulers.newSingle() for each call.
 *
 * An unbounded elastic thread pool (Schedulers.elastic()). This one is no longer preferred with the introduction of
 * Schedulers.boundedElastic(), as it has a tendency to hide backpressure problems and lead to too many threads (see below).
 *
 * A bounded elastic thread pool (Schedulers.boundedElastic()). Like its predecessor elastic(), it creates new worker
 * pools as needed and reuses idle ones. Worker pools that stay idle for too long (the default is 60s) are also disposed.
 * Unlike its elastic() predecessor, it has a cap on the number of backing threads it can create (default is number of
 * CPU cores x 10). Up to 100 000 tasks submitted after the cap has been reached are enqueued and will be re-scheduled
 * when a thread becomes available (when scheduling with a delay, the delay starts when the thread becomes available).
 * This is a better choice for I/O blocking work. Schedulers.boundedElastic() is a handy way to give a blocking process
 * its own thread so that it does not tie up other resources. See How Do I Wrap a Synchronous, Blocking Call?, but doesnâ€™t
 * pressure the system too much with new threads.
 *
 * A fixed pool of workers that is tuned for parallel work (Schedulers.parallel()). It creates as many workers as you
 * have CPU cores.
 *
 * Additionally, you can create a Scheduler out of any pre-existing ExecutorService by using Schedulers.fromExecutorService(ExecutorService).
 * (You can also create one from an Executor, although doing so is discouraged.)
